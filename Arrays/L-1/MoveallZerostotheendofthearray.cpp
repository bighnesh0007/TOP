In this article we will learn how to solve the most asked coding interview problem: "Move all Zeros to the end of the array"

Problem Statement: You are given an array of integers, your task is to move all the zeros in the array to the end of the array and move non-negative integers to the front by maintaining their order.

Examples
Example 1:
Input:
 1 ,0 ,2 ,3 ,0 ,4 ,0 ,1
Output:
 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,1 ,0 ,0 ,0
Explanation:
 All the zeros are moved to the end and non-negative integers are moved to front by maintaining order

Example 2:
Input:
 1,2,0,1,0,4,0
Output:
 1,2,1,4,0,0,0
Explanation:
 All the zeros are moved to the end and non-negative integers are moved to front by maintaining order
